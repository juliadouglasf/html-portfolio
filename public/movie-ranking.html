<h3>How to Train Your Dragon</h3>
<p>A classic dragon movie. Nostalgic and beautiful.</p>
<h3>Ella Enchanted</h3>
<p>Unwilling princess, portals, and a dragon!</p>
<h3>Cabras da Peste</h3>
<p>Called "Get the Goat" in English, this movie is a hilarious comedy of low-level crime and incompetent police officers.</p>
